# FAKE_NEWS_DETECTION_USING_MACHINE-LEARNING
Utilized machine learning algorithms to develop a fake news detection system. Implemented natural language processing techniques to analyze text features and detect misinformation with high accuracy. Validated the model on diverse datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in combatting the spread of false information in digital media.


## 1.Introduction
These days‟ fake news is creating different issues from sarcastic articles to a fabricated news and plan government propaganda in some outlets. Fake news and lack of trust in the media are growing problems with huge ramifications in our society. Obviously, a purposely misleading story is “fake news “but lately blathering social media’s discourse is changing its definition. Some of them now use the term to dismiss the facts counter to their preferred viewpoints. The importance of disinformation within American political discourse was the subject of weighty attention, particularly following the American president election.The term 'fake news' became common parlance for the issue, particularly to describe factually incorrect and misleading articles published mostly for the purpose of making money through 
page views. In this paper, it is seeked to produce a model that can accurately predict the likelihood that a given article is fake news. Facebook has been at the epicenter of much critique following media attention. They have also said publicly they are working on to distinguish these articles in an automated way. Certainly, it is not an easy task. A given algorithm must bepolitically unbiased – since fake news exists on both ends of the spectrum – and also give equal balance to legitimate news sources on either end of the spectrum. In this era of fake news and information manipulation, the ability to discern genuine news from spam is not only a technological challenge but also a matter of societal importance. News organizations, social media platforms, and content aggregators are increasingly incorporating 
news spam detection systems into their workflows to maintain the integrity of the information they deliver to their audiences.News spam detection involves the use of advanced technology, particularly machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), to automatically distinguish between legitimate news articles and spammy or misleading content. By leveraging statistical patterns, linguistic cues, and contextual information, these systems can help ensure that readers are presented with trustworthy and reliable news source.
